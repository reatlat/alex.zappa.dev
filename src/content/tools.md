Welcome to a curated collection of my favorite developer tools! In this compilation, you'll find a range of efficient
tools that enhance productivity and streamline workflows for developers. These tools include powerful IDEs, terminal
replacements, code storage and assistance platforms, website hosting and development environments, supercharged web
browsers, git clients, password managers, productivity boosters, and code snippets managers. Join me in exploring these
exceptional tools and supercharge your development process!

## JetBrains Developer Tools

JetBrains makes some of the best developer tools out there. I
use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/),
and [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) on a daily basis.

JetBrains also makes a great IDE for Go, Ruby, and [many other languages](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/).

## iTerm2

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It works on Macs with macOS
10.10 or newer. iTerm2 brings the terminal into the modern age with features you never knew you always wanted.

## GitHub with CoPilot

Everyone needs a place to store their code. I've use Bitbucket, and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/reatlat) in the past,
but went all-in on [GitHub](https://github.com/reatlat). It's the primary store for all my personal and private
projects, and I make sure that I have local backups with [gickup](https://github.com/cooperspencer/gickup).
[GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot") is an AI pair programmer that helps you write better code. It's a
great tool for learning new languages, and for getting started with new projects.

## Netlify

The majority of sites that I build today use [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/), and are hosted
by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). If a site needs any interactivity, Netlify Functions provides everything that I
need.

## CodePen

[CodePen](https://codepen.io/reatlat) is a social development environment for front-end designers and developers. Build
and deploy a website, show off your work, build test cases to learn and debug, and find inspiration.

## WaveBox

WaveBox is more than just a browser. It's a desktop app that brings together all your web apps into one place. It's a
supercharged web browser with tabbed windows, notifications, badges, and workspaces.

I use WaveBix since first day it was released. WaveBox is successor to [WMail](https://thomas101.github.io/wmail/),
which was a great desktop client for Gmail. WaveBox is a great way to keep all of my work and personal email accounts in
one place.

## Fork

[Fork](https://git-fork.com/) is a fast and friendly git client for Mac and Windows. Fork is getting better and better
every day and we are happy to share our results with you.</p>

## 1Password

[1Password](https://1password.com/) is a password manager that keeps you safe online. It's the only way to keep your
accounts safe from password reuse, phishing, and other online threats.

I'm a long time 1Password user, and have managed to convince all of my immediate family to use it too. Shared vaults are
great for tech support, and they allow my wife, son and I to keep track of documents that we need.

Autocomplete works great, and it's the single source of truth for all of my software licenses and club memberships. I
couldn't live without it.

## Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is an award-winning app for macOS which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys,
keywords, text expansion and more. Search your Mac and the web, and be more productive with custom actions to control
your Mac.

I started out using Alfred as a Spotlight replacement many years ago. Somewhere along the way I picked up a lifetime
Mega supporter license and use it every day.

Most of the time it's a quick application launcher, but I have a couple of downloaded workflows (such as the emoji
picker), and some custom workflows for navigating to specific work systems quickly.

I've recently started using it's snippets capability, both for common replies and for demo purposes (with autoexpand
enabled).

## massCode

[massCode](https://masscode.io/) is a free and open source code snippets manager for developers. It helps you create and
organize your own personal snippets collection and have quick access to it.

I've been using massCode for a while now, and it's a great way to keep track of code snippets that I use regularly. I've
got a few snippets that I use for demos, and a few more that I use for common replies.
