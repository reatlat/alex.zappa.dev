On [Campaign URL Builder](/blog/wp-plugin-campaign-url-builder/) plugin, I decided finally move to Bitly API endpoint.

Since March 2019, [Campaign URL Builder](/blog/wp-plugin-campaign-url-builder/) plugin will be turning down support for
goo.gl URL shortener. Previously created links will continue to redirect to their intended destination. Please see this
[Google blog post](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/transitioning-google-url-shortener.html) for more details.
